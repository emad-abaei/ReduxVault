## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This project was originally inspired by a course by **Jonas Schmedtmann**. The course focused on implementing the logic in **JavaScript** without a UI.

I extended the project by:  
✅ Implementing a full **UI** using **React & Tailwind CSS**  
✅ Migrating the codebase to **TypeScript** for better type safety  
✅ Adding extra features and enhancements
